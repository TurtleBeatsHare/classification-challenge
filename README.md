## Module 13 Challenge: Classification

Calculation and comparison of a Logistic Regression and Random Forest model to classify emails as spam. Both models exhibited strong accuracy in both training and test data sets with the random forest model edging out the logistic regression by ~3%.

A straight forward excersize that shows the power of sklearn's ease of use.

Fun project!
